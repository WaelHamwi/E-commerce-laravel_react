Here‚Äôs what makes this project stand out: ### üåü Features #### 1. **Secure Payment Integration** - **Stripe Integration**: The application integrates with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to handle secure payment processing. Stripe provides a reliable and secure method for users to make transactions, manage payment methods, and handle refunds. It supports various payment options, including credit/debit cards and digital wallets, ensuring a safe and user-friendly checkout experience. #### 2. **Image Upload Progress Bar** - **Progress Bar for Image Uploading**: A visual progress bar is provided for users during the image upload process. This feature enhances the user experience by showing real-time upload status and feedback, making the process more interactive and engaging. #### 3. **Big Data Management** - **Efficient Data Handling**: The application is designed to handle large amounts of data efficiently. It uses pagination and chunking techniques to manage large datasets, ensuring that performance remains optimal even with extensive product catalogs and user data. #### 4. **Enhanced User Experience** - **Native CSS**: The project is built using native CSS only, which ensures that styles are clean, maintainable, and optimized for performance. This approach enhances the user experience by providing a visually appealing and consistent design across different devices and browsers. #### 5. **Modern Front-End Technologies** - **React and Redux**: The frontend is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management. These technologies provide a dynamic and responsive user interface, with components that are reusable and easy to maintain. - **React Router**: For seamless navigation between different pages of the application, [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is used. This allows for client-side routing and improves the overall navigation experience. - **Styled Components**: [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) are used for styling, which allows for writing CSS-in-JS and provides a modular approach to design with enhanced maintainability. #### 6. **Rich Component Library** - **FontAwesome Icons**: [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons are used for a wide range of UI elements, including buttons, social media links, and navigation components. - **React Toastify**: [React Toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction) is used for displaying notifications and alerts in a user-friendly manner. - **React Paginate**: [React Paginate](https://github.com/AdeleD/react-paginate) is used for pagination in product listings and other data-heavy pages, improving usability and performance. - **React Loading Skeleton**: [React Loading Skeleton](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loading-skeleton) is used to display skeleton screens during data fetching, providing a smoother and more engaging user experience. #### 7. **Social Authentication** - **Google Sign-In**: [Laravel Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/socialite) is used for Google Sign-In, allowing users to authenticate using their Google accounts for a simplified and secure login process. ### üìÇ Project Structure - **Backend**: Developed using Laravel with features like API authentication, database management, and server-side logic. - **Frontend**: Developed using React with features like state management, routing, and interactive UI components. ### üèóÔ∏è Technologies Used - **Backend**: Laravel, PHP 8.1, Laravel Passport, MySQL - **Frontend**: React, Redux, React Router, FontAwesome, Styled Components, Native CSS - **Payment Processing**: Stripe API - **Authentication**: Google Sign-In via Laravel Socialite - **Data Handling**: Pagination, Chunking, React Loading Skeleton ### üöÄ Getting Started Welcome to the E-commerce Laravel & React Project!
